- make input scrollable so bigger inputs can be put in
- make a readme file with proper documentation, including instructions/ directions of use
- clean up code, get rid a lot of the useless logging, and maybe just keep some essential STUFF
- turn graph into object and turn whole program proper OOP
- turn input and graph into seperate modules that are imported for neatness
